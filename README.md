# Shopify AI Product Content Generator

A lightweight AI-powered tool for generating **SEO-optimised Shopify product content** such as titles, descriptions, bullet benefits, meta descriptions, tags, and image alt text.

Built to demonstrate a **realistic agency-style approach** to integrating AI into ecommerce workflows while keeping API keys secure and maintaining clean separation between frontend and backend.

## 📌 Purpose

Creating consistent, high-quality product content at scale is a common challenge for Shopify merchants and agencies.

This project shows how AI can be used responsibly to:
- Speed up product content creation
- Improve SEO consistency
- Support internal ecommerce tooling
- Avoid exposing sensitive credentials on the frontend

---

## 🧩 Architecture

The project is intentionally split into two parts:

- **Frontend** – a simple static UI for input and output display  
- **Backend** – a Node.js API that handles AI requests securely  

This mirrors how production ecommerce tooling is typically structured.
